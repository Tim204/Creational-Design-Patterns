Builder Method is a Creation Design Pattern which aims to “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
so that the same construction process can create different representations.” It allows you to construct complex objects step by step.
Here using the same construction code, we can produce different types and representations of the object easily.

It is basically designed to provide flexibility to the solutions to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming.
